# learn-simple-pandas

_"Pandas is an open-source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data-wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem, and is typically included in every Python distribution, from those that come with your operating system to commercial vendor distributions like ActiveStateâ€™s ActivePython".

This repository created to help the developers who want to engage in #Data-science or #Data-analysis to learn and know about #pandas without feeling conflicted or complexed.

A simple repository that helps you to understand the general tools of Pandas that you will need to enter the world of data science and data analysis. 

This repository is about [#jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files: each one of them includes a topic about pandas and what does each tool do.

Also - you will find datasets to inplement the work included into each jupyter-notebook.
